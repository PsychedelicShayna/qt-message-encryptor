# Qt Message Encryptor
This is a general purpose message encryptor that supports RSA key exchanging of randomly generated AES cipherkeys. Made to communicate sensitive information in cases where a messaging service cannot be fully trusted.

This program is long overdue for an update and proper release. While the program technically works, the user interface is far from intuitive. I would wait for an update before using.
